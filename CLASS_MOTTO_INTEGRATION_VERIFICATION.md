# âœ… Class Motto Integration Verification

## Overview
The class motto functionality in advisory forms is now properly integrated with yearbook display across all academic departments. The `messageToStudents` field from advisory forms is correctly stored, fetched, and displayed as the class motto in yearbook pages.

## Implementation Details

### **1. Advisory Form Field Mapping**
- **Form Field**: `messageToStudents` (labeled as "Class Motto" in the UI)
- **Database Field**: `messageToStudents` 
- **Yearbook Display**: Used as the class motto in yearbook pages
- **Required Field**: Yes, for advisory profiles

### **2. Data Flow Verification**

#### **Manual Profile Creation (Admin)**
1. **Admin fills advisory form** â†’ `messageToStudents` field populated
2. **Form submitted** â†’ `/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/manual`
3. **Profile stored** â†’ Department-specific yearbook collection (e.g., `Elementary_yearbook`)
4. **Field mapping** â†’ `messageToStudents` preserved in profile document
5. **Auto-approved** â†’ Profile appears immediately in yearbook

#### **User Profile Submission**
1. **User fills advisory form** â†’ `messageToStudents` field populated
2. **Form submitted** â†’ `/api/profiles`
3. **Profile stored** â†’ Department-specific yearbook collection
4. **Field mapping** â†’ `messageToStudents` preserved in profile document
5. **Pending approval** â†’ Admin must approve before appearing in yearbook

### **3. Yearbook Integration**

#### **Updated Yearbook Pages**
All yearbook pages now correctly fetch class motto from advisory profiles:

- **Elementary Yearbook**: `app/school-years-elementary/[schoolYearId]/departments/elementary/[gradeId]/[sectionId]/yearbook/page.tsx`
- **Junior High Yearbook**: `app/school-years-junior-high/[schoolYearId]/departments/junior-high/[gradeId]/[sectionId]/yearbook/page.tsx`
- **Senior High Yearbook**: `app/school-years-senior-high/[schoolYearId]/departments/senior-high/[strandId]/[yearId]/[sectionId]/yearbook/page.tsx`
- **College Yearbook**: `app/school-years-college/[schoolYearId]/departments/college/[courseId]/[yearId]/[blockId]/yearbook/page.tsx`

#### **Updated Query Logic**
```typescript
// Before: Looking for profiles with special advisory entry fields
const advisoryProfile = result.data.find((profile: any) => 
  profile.isAdvisoryEntry && 
  profile.userType === 'advisory' &&
  profile.messageToStudents
)

// After: Looking for advisory profiles directly
const advisoryProfile = result.data.find((profile: any) => 
  profile.userType === 'advisory' &&
  profile.messageToStudents
)
```

### **4. API Endpoints Updated**

- âœ… Includes `messageToStudents` in required fields for advisory profiles
- âœ… Properly stores `messageToStudents` in profile document
