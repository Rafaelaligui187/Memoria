console.log("\n📋 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:")
console.log("• Faculty and Staff page dropdown filter not showing utility profiles")
console.log("• When 'Utility' was selected, no profiles were displayed")
console.log("• Issue was in the frontend filtering logic")

console.log("\n🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
console.log("• Located in: app/faculty/page.tsx")
console.log("• Function: filteredFaculty filter logic")
console.log("• Problem: Still referenced 'Maintenance' instead of 'Utility'")
console.log("• Line 169: (selectedDepartment === 'Maintenance' && faculty.hierarchy === 'maintenance')")
console.log("• Result: Utility profiles were not being filtered correctly")

console.log("\n📝 BEFORE (Broken Code):")
console.log(`
const filteredFaculty = facultyData.filter((faculty) => {
  const matchesDepartment =
    selectedDepartment === "All" ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Faculty" && faculty.hierarchy === "faculty") ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Staff" && faculty.hierarchy === "staff") ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Maintenance" && faculty.hierarchy === "maintenance") ||  // ❌ Wrong
    faculty.department === selectedDepartment
  // ... rest of filter logic
})
`)

console.log("\n✅ AFTER (Fixed Code):")
console.log(`
const filteredFaculty = facultyData.filter((faculty) => {
  const matchesDepartment =
    selectedDepartment === "All" ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Faculty" && faculty.hierarchy === "faculty") ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Staff" && faculty.hierarchy === "staff") ||
    (selectedDepartment === "Utility" && faculty.hierarchy === "utility") ||  // ✅ Fixed
    faculty.department === selectedDepartment
  // ... rest of filter logic
})
`)

console.log("\n🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:")
console.log("• File Modified: app/faculty/page.tsx")
console.log("• Line Modified: ~169 (changed 'Maintenance' to 'Utility')")
console.log("• Filter Logic: Updated to match hierarchy === 'utility'")
console.log("• API Route: Already handled utility correctly")
console.log("• Database: Utility profiles stored in FacultyStaff_yearbook collection")

console.log("\n✅ VERIFICATION CHECKS:")
console.log("1. ✅ Frontend Filter Fixed - Updated 'Maintenance' to 'Utility'")
console.log("2. ✅ API Route Verified - Already handles utility correctly")
console.log("3. ✅ Database Collection - FacultyStaff_yearbook contains utility profiles")
console.log("4. ✅ Build Test - npm run build completed successfully (exit code: 0)")
console.log("5. ✅ Linting - No errors found")
console.log("6. ✅ Audit Logs - Confirmed utility profile exists in database")

console.log("\n🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:")
console.log("• When 'Utility' is selected in dropdown, utility profiles should display")
console.log("• Utility profiles should show with correct hierarchy and userType")
console.log("• Filter should work correctly for all role types:")
console.log("  - All: Shows all faculty, staff, and utility profiles")
console.log("  - Faculty: Shows only faculty profiles")
console.log("  - Staff: Shows only staff profiles")
console.log("  - Utility: Shows only utility profiles ✅ (FIXED)")

console.log("\n📊 FILTERING LOGIC SUMMARY:")
console.log("• selectedDepartment === 'All' → Shows all profiles")
console.log("• selectedDepartment === 'Faculty' → faculty.hierarchy === 'faculty'")
console.log("• selectedDepartment === 'Staff' → faculty.hierarchy === 'staff'")
console.log("• selectedDepartment === 'Utility' → faculty.hierarchy === 'utility' ✅ (FIXED)")
