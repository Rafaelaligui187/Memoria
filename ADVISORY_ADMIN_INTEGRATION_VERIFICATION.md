# âœ… Advisory Profile Admin Integration Verification

## Overview
Advisory profiles created through manual profile creation are now properly fetched and displayed in the admin page's user accounts section. The integration ensures that advisory profiles appear alongside other user types in the account management interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Admin Profiles API** (`app/api/admin/profiles/route.ts`)
- **Fixed Profile Filtering**: Removed the restrictive filter that only showed advisory profiles with `isAdvisoryEntry` and `originalAdvisoryId` fields
- **Updated Filter Logic**: Now shows all advisory profiles since they're stored directly in yearbook collections
- **Maintained Role Mapping**: Advisory profiles are correctly mapped to "Advisory" role

```typescript
// Before: Only showed advisory profiles with special fields
if (profile.userType === "advisory") {
  return profile.isAdvisoryEntry && profile.originalAdvisoryId
}

// After: Shows all advisory profiles
if (profile.userType === "advisory") {
  return true // Show all advisory profiles since they're now stored directly in yearbook collections
}
```

### 2. **Updated Account Management Components**

#### **Account Interface Updates**
- **`components/account-management.tsx`**: Added "Advisory" to the Account role type
- **`components/enhanced-account-management.tsx`**: Added "Advisory" to the Account role type
- **`components/profile-approval-system.tsx`**: Added "Advisory" to the ProfileSubmission role type

#### **Role Selection Dropdowns**
Updated all role filter dropdowns to include "Advisory":
- Account Management role filter
- Enhanced Account Management role filter  
- Profile Approval System role filter

#### **Profile Creation Forms**
- Added "Advisory" option to role selection in manual profile creation
- Ensured advisory profiles can be created through admin interface

### 3. **Data Flow Verification**

#### **Manual Profile Creation Flow**
1. **Admin creates manual advisory profile** â†’ `/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/manual`
2. **Profile stored directly** â†’ Department-specific yearbook collection (e.g., `Elementary_yearbook`)
3. **Profile auto-approved** â†’ `status: "approved"`, `profileStatus: "approved"`
4. **Profile appears in admin accounts** â†’ `/api/admin/profiles`

#### **User Profile Submission Flow**
1. **User submits advisory profile** â†’ `/api/profiles`
2. **Profile stored directly** â†’ Department-specific yearbook collection
3. **Profile pending approval** â†’ `status: "pending"`, `profileStatus: "pending"`
4. **Profile appears in admin accounts** â†’ `/api/admin/profiles`
5. **Admin can approve/reject** â†’ Profile status updated
