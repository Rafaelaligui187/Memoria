## Implementation Verification

### **1. Dynamic Form Data Support**
The advisory form uses `/api/admin/form-data` to fetch real-time academic structure data:

```typescript
// Fetches dynamic data from database
const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/form-data?schoolYearId=${schoolYearId}`)
const result = await response.json()

// Fallback to comprehensive hardcoded data
setDepartmentData({
  "Elementary": {
    yearLevels: ["Grade 1", "Grade 2", "Grade 3", "Grade 4", "Grade 5", "Grade 6"],
    programs: ["Elementary"],
    sections: ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
  },
  "Junior High": {
    yearLevels: ["Grade 7", "Grade 8", "Grade 9", "Grade 10"],
    programs: ["Junior High"],
    sections: ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
  },
  "Senior High": {
    yearLevels: ["Grade 11", "Grade 12"],
    programs: ["STEM", "HUMSS", "ABM", "TVL", "HE", "ICT"],
    sections: ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
  },
  "College": {
    yearLevels: ["1st Year", "2nd Year", "3rd Year", "4th Year"],
    programs: ["BS Information Technology", "BS Education", "BS Business Administration", "BS Psychology", "BS Engineering"],
    sections: ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
  },
})
```

### **2. Field Mapping Consistency**
All advisory profiles use consistent field mapping across all academic structures:

```typescript
// For advisory profiles, map academic fields to yearbook fields
...(userType === "advisory" && {
  department: profileData.academicDepartment,        // academicDepartment ‚Üí department
  yearLevel: profileData.academicYearLevel,           // academicYearLevel ‚Üí yearLevel
  courseProgram: profileData.academicCourseProgram || profileData.academicDepartment,
  blockSection: profileData.academicSection || "All Sections",
}),
```

### **3. Collection Mapping Logic**
The system correctly maps advisory profiles to department-specific collections:

```typescript
const departmentMappings: Record<string, string> = {
  'College': YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS.COLLEGE,        // 'College_yearbook'
  'Senior High': YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS.SENIOR_HIGH, // 'SeniorHigh_yearbook'
  'Junior High': YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS.JUNIOR_HIGH,  // 'JuniorHigh_yearbook'
  'Elementary': YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS.ELEMENTARY,    // 'Elementary_yearbook'
}
```
