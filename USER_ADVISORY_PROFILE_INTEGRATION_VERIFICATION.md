# ‚úÖ User-Submitted Advisory Profile Integration Verification

## Overview
User-submitted advisory profiles are now properly integrated with the yearbook system. The issue where user-submitted advisory profiles were not appearing in yearbook pages after admin approval has been resolved.

## Problem Identified and Fixed

### **Root Cause**
The issue was in the user profile submission API (`app/api/profiles/route.ts`). While advisory profiles were being stored in the correct department-specific collections, the academic field mapping was missing. This meant that:

1. **User-submitted advisory profiles** were stored with `academicDepartment`, `academicYearLevel`, etc.
2. **Yearbook pages** were looking for `department`, `yearLevel`, etc.
3. **Field mismatch** prevented profiles from appearing in yearbook pages

### **Solution Applied**
Added academic field mapping to the user profile submission API to match the manual profile creation API:

```typescript
// For advisory profiles, map academic fields to yearbook fields
...(userType === "advisory" && {
  department: profileData.academicDepartment,
  yearLevel: profileData.academicYearLevel,
  courseProgram: profileData.academicCourseProgram || profileData.academicDepartment,
  blockSection: profileData.academicSection || "All Sections",
}),
```

## Changes Made

### **1. Updated User Profile Submission API** (`app/api/profiles/route.ts`)

#### **Added Academic Field Mapping**
Applied the same academic field mapping logic used in manual profile creation to all profile creation and update scenarios:

- **New Profile Creation**: Maps academic fields to yearbook fields
- **Admin Profile Updates**: Maps academic fields when admin edits approved profiles
- **User Profile Updates**: Maps academic fields when users edit approved profiles
- **Pending Profile Updates**: Maps academic fields when updating pending profiles
- **Rejected Profile Updates**: Maps academic fields when resubmitting rejected profiles

#### **Field Mapping Logic**
```typescript
// For advisory profiles, map academic fields to yearbook fields
...(userType === "advisory" && {
  department: profileData.academicDepartment,        // academicDepartment ‚Üí department
  yearLevel: profileData.academicYearLevel,           // academicYearLevel ‚Üí yearLevel
  courseProgram: profileData.academicCourseProgram || profileData.academicDepartment, // academicCourseProgram ‚Üí courseProgram
  blockSection: profileData.academicSection || "All Sections", // academicSection ‚Üí blockSection
}),
```

### **2. Updated Profile Approval API** (`app/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/[profileId]/approve/route.ts`)

#### **Removed Obsolete Logic**
- **Removed**: `advisory_profiles` collection from search collections
- **Removed**: Old yearbook entry creation logic for advisory profiles
- **Simplified**: Advisory profiles are now stored directly in department collections

#### **Updated Collection Search**
```typescript
// Before: Included advisory_profiles collection
const collectionsToSearch = [...Object.values(YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS), 'advisory_profiles']

// After: Only yearbook collections (advisory profiles stored directly)
const collectionsToSearch = [...Object.values(YEARBOOK_COLLECTIONS)]
```

## Data Flow Verification

### **User Profile Submission Flow**
1. **User fills advisory form** ‚Üí `academicDepartment`, `academicYearLevel`, etc.
2. **Form submitted** ‚Üí `/api/profiles`
3. **Field mapping applied** ‚Üí `academicDepartment` ‚Üí `department`, etc.
4. **Profile stored** ‚Üí Department-specific yearbook collection (e.g., `Elementary_yearbook`)
5. **Status set** ‚Üí `status: "pending"` (requires admin approval)
6. **Profile appears** ‚Üí In admin profiles API with pending status

### **Admin Approval Flow**
1. **Admin approves profile** ‚Üí `/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/[profileId]/approve`
2. **Status updated** ‚Üí `status: "approved"`
3. **No additional processing** ‚Üí Profile already in correct collection with correct fields
4. **Profile appears** ‚Üí In yearbook pages immediately

### **Yearbook Display Flow**
1. **Yearbook page loads** ‚Üí Fetches profiles from department-specific collection
2. **Query executed** ‚Üí Looks for profiles with `userType: 'advisory'`
3. **Profile found** ‚Üí Uses `department`, `yearLevel`, `courseProgram`, `blockSection` fields
4. **Class motto displayed** ‚Üí Uses `messageToStudents` field
