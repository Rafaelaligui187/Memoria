# Hardcoded School Years Removal - Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The `app/faculty/page.tsx` file contained **hardcoded school years** that were problematic:

### ❌ **Problems Found:**
1. **Outdated Years**: Hardcoded years were `2024-2025, 2023-2024, 2022-2023, 2021-2022` - but we're now in **2025**
2. **Duplicate Code**: The same hardcoded array appeared **twice** in the error handling
3. **Inconsistent Approach**: Staff page (`app/staff/page.tsx`) didn't have hardcoded fallbacks
4. **Static Data**: Hardcoded years wouldn't automatically update for new academic years

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Hardcoded Arrays** (Lines 141-146 and 152-157):
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (Problematic):
   setSchoolYears([
     { _id: "2024-2025", yearLabel: "2024-2025", isActive: true },
     { _id: "2023-2024", yearLabel: "2023-2024", isActive: false },
     { _id: "2022-2023", yearLabel: "2022-2023", isActive: false },
     { _id: "2021-2022", yearLabel: "2021-2022", isActive: false },
   ])
   setSelectedSchoolYear("2024-2025")
   
   // AFTER (Fixed):
   setSchoolYears([])
   ```

2. **Updated Error Handling**:
   ```typescript
   } else {
     console.error('[Faculty Page] Failed to fetch school years:', result.error)
     // Set empty array if API fails - let admin create school years
     setSchoolYears([])
   }
   ```

3. **Fixed Clear Filters Button** (Line 388):
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE:
   setSelectedSchoolYear("2024-2025")
   
   // AFTER:
   setSelectedSchoolYear("")
   ```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Error Handling Strategy:**
- **API Success**: Use dynamic school years from database
- **API Failure**: Set empty array and let admin create school years
- **Consistent Logging**: Added `[Faculty Page]` prefix for better debugging

### **Benefits:**
1. **Dynamic Data**: School years now come from database, not hardcoded
2. **Admin Control**: Admins can create/manage school years through admin interface
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Matches staff page approach
4. **Future-Proof**: No need to manually update hardcoded years
5. **Better Error Handling**: Clear logging and graceful degradation

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created test script: `scripts/test-hardcoded-school-years-removal.js`

### **Test Results:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: No hardcoded school years found in faculty page
✅ Empty array fallback: Implemented
✅ Proper error logging: Implemented  
✅ No duplicate arrays: Confirmed
🎉 ALL CHECKS PASSED: Hardcoded school years successfully removed!
```

## 📋 **Files Modified**
