# ‚úÖ Building Assignment Display - Implementation Complete

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

Implemented automatic building assignment display for Faculty and Staff profiles based on their respective assignments. Faculty profiles show building assignments based on "Department Assigned", while Staff and Utility profiles show building assignments based on "Office Assigned". This ensures accurate building information is displayed without manual input.

## üîß **Technical Notes**

### **Data Structure**
```typescript
interface BuildingAssignment {
  building: string      // Building name to display
  location: string      // Specific location within campus
  description?: string  // Optional description
}
```

### **Performance Considerations**
