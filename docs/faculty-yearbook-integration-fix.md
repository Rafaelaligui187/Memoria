# Faculty Profile Yearbook Integration Fix

## üéØ **Issue Description**

Faculty profiles were being created with academic information (department, year levels, course programs, sections) but were not appearing in the specific yearbook pages they were assigned to. The profiles only showed up in the general Faculty & Staff page but not in the department-specific yearbook pages (e.g., College yearbook, Elementary yearbook, etc.).

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem**
1. **Collection Separation**: Faculty profiles are stored in the `FacultyStaff_yearbook` collection
2. **Yearbook Page Filtering**: Yearbook pages query department-specific collections (`College_yearbook`, `Elementary_yearbook`, etc.)
3. **Missing Integration**: Faculty profiles with academic assignments were not being replicated to the appropriate department collections
4. **Filtering Logic**: Yearbook pages filter by `department`, `yearLevel`, `courseProgram`, and `blockSection` fields that weren't present in faculty profiles

### **Data Flow Issue**
```
Faculty Profile Creation ‚Üí FacultyStaff_yearbook collection
Yearbook Page Query ‚Üí Department-specific collections (College_yearbook, etc.)
Result: Faculty profiles not found in yearbook pages
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Profile Creation Logic**

#### **Modified Files:**
- `app/api/profiles/route.ts` - Regular faculty profile creation
- `app/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/manual/route.ts` - Admin manual profile creation

#### **New Logic Added:**
When a faculty profile is created with academic assignments, the system now:

1. **Creates the main profile** in `FacultyStaff_yearbook` collection
2. **Identifies academic assignments** from `academicDepartment`, `academicYearLevels`, `academicCourseProgram`, and `academicSections`
3. **Creates additional entries** in the appropriate department-specific collections
4. **Maps academic fields** to yearbook filtering fields:
   - `academicDepartment` ‚Üí `department`
   - `academicYearLevels` ‚Üí `yearLevel`
   - `academicCourseProgram` ‚Üí `courseProgram`
   - `academicSections` ‚Üí `blockSection`

### **2. Academic Entry Creation Process**

```typescript
// For each academic assignment
for (const yearLevel of profileData.academicYearLevels) {
  if (profileData.academicSections?.length > 0) {
    // Create entries for specific sections
    for (const sectionKey of profileData.academicSections) {
      const [sectionName, sectionYearLevel] = sectionKey.split('-')
      
      if (sectionYearLevel === yearLevel) {
        const facultyYearbookEntry = {
          ...profileDocument,
          department: profileData.academicDepartment,
          yearLevel: yearLevel,
          courseProgram: profileData.academicCourseProgram,
          blockSection: sectionName,
          isFacultyEntry: true,
          originalFacultyId: result.insertedId,
          status: profileDocument.status,
        }
        
        await departmentCollection.insertOne(facultyYearbookEntry)
      }
    }
  } else {
    // Create general entry for year level
    const facultyYearbookEntry = {
      ...profileDocument,
      department: profileData.academicDepartment,
      yearLevel: yearLevel,
      courseProgram: profileData.academicCourseProgram,
      blockSection: "All Sections",
      isFacultyEntry: true,
      originalFacultyId: result.insertedId,
      status: profileDocument.status,
    }
    
    await departmentCollection.insertOne(facultyYearbookEntry)
  }
}
```

### **3. Migration Script for Existing Profiles**

Created `scripts/migrate-faculty-academic-entries.js` to:
- Find existing faculty profiles with academic assignments
- Create missing academic entries in department collections
- Avoid duplicate entries
- Provide detailed logging of the migration process

## üìä **Data Structure Changes**

### **Faculty Profile Fields Used:**
- `academicDepartment` - The department the faculty is assigned to (College, Elementary, etc.)
- `academicYearLevels` - Array of year levels the faculty teaches
- `academicCourseProgram` - The specific course/program (BSIT, Grade 1, etc.)
- `academicSections` - Array of sections/blocks the faculty is assigned to

### **Yearbook Entry Fields Created:**
- `department` - Mapped from `academicDepartment`
- `yearLevel` - Mapped from `academicYearLevels`
- `courseProgram` - Mapped from `academicCourseProgram`
- `blockSection` - Mapped from `academicSections`
- `isFacultyEntry` - Boolean flag to identify faculty entries
- `originalFacultyId` - Reference to the main faculty profile

## üîÑ **Updated Data Flow**

```
Faculty Profile Creation
    ‚Üì
Main Profile ‚Üí FacultyStaff_yearbook collection
    ‚Üì
Academic Assignment Detection
    ‚Üì
For each academic assignment:
    ‚Üì
Create Entry ‚Üí Department-specific collection
    ‚Üì
Yearbook Page Query ‚Üí Finds faculty entries
    ‚Üì
Faculty appears in correct yearbook pages ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Faculty profile created with academic information
- Profile appears only in Faculty & Staff page
- Profile does NOT appear in department yearbook pages

### **After Fix:**
- Faculty profile created with academic information
- Profile appears in Faculty & Staff page
- Profile ALSO appears in appropriate department yearbook pages
- Faculty shows as "Adviser" in yearbook pages

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Scenario:**
1. **Create faculty profile** with academic assignments:
   - Academic Department: "College"
   - Year Levels: ["1st Year", "2nd Year"]
   - Course Program: "BSIT"
   - Sections: ["Block A-1st Year", "Block B-2nd Year"]

2. **Expected Results:**
   - Profile appears in Faculty & Staff page
   - Profile appears in College yearbook pages for:
     - BSIT 1st Year Block A
     - BSIT 2nd Year Block B

3. **Verify in Database:**
   - Main profile in `FacultyStaff_yearbook`
   - Academic entries in `College_yearbook` with correct filtering fields

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **Error Handling:**
- Academic entry creation failures don't prevent main profile creation
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Academic entries are created only when needed
- Duplicate prevention logic
- Efficient database queries

### **Maintenance:**
- Migration script for existing profiles
- Clear logging for troubleshooting
- Consistent data structure across collections

## üìù **Notes**

- This fix ensures faculty profiles with academic assignments appear in the correct yearbook pages
- The solution maintains data consistency across collections
- Existing faculty profiles can be migrated using the provided script
- Future faculty profile creations will automatically create academic entries
- The fix is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality

## üöÄ **Deployment**

1. Deploy the updated API endpoints
2. Run the migration script for existing profiles
3. Test faculty profile creation with academic assignments
4. Verify faculty profiles appear in correct yearbook pages
