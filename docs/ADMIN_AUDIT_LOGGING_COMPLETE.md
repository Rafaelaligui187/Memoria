# Admin Audit Logging Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
I have successfully implemented comprehensive audit logging for all admin actions across Gallery & Albums, School Years management, and Reports & Messages. The system now tracks every administrative action with detailed information for transparency and accountability.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Audit Log Utils (`lib/audit-log-utils.ts`)
**Added New Action Types**:
- **Gallery & Albums**: `album_created`, `album_updated`, `album_deleted`, `media_uploaded`, `media_deleted`
- **School Years**: `school_year_created`, `school_year_updated`, `school_year_deleted`, `school_year_activated`, `school_year_deactivated`
- **Reports & Messages**: `report_created`, `report_updated`, `report_deleted`, `report_resolved`, `message_replied`, `message_deleted`

### 2. ✅ Gallery & Albums Audit Logging

#### Album Creation (`app/api/gallery/albums/route.ts`)
- ✅ Logs when admin creates new albums
- ✅ Captures album details: title, category, yearId, visibility settings

### 4. ✅ Reports & Messages Audit Logging

- ✅ Captures admin replies and assignments
- ✅ Differentiates between updates and resolutions
- ✅ Records user information and report details

#### Report Deletion (`app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts`)

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Audit Logs System UI (`components/audit-logs-system.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated action types list to include all new actions

- ✅ Maintains existing functionality while supporting new audit types

## Audit Log Data Structure

Each audit log entry includes:

```json

  "userId": "admin",
  "userName": "Admin",
  "action": "<specific_action>",
  "targetType": "<album|school_year|report|media>",
  "targetId": "<unique_identifier>",
  "targetName": "<human_readable_name>",
  "details": {
    // Action-specific data
    "originalData": { /* for updates */ },
    "updatedData": { /* for updates */ },
    "changes": [ /* list of changed fields */ ],
    "deletedData": { /* for deletions */ }
  },
  "schoolYearId": "<school_year_id>",
  "userAgent": "<browser_info>",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "<creation_timestamp>"
}
```
