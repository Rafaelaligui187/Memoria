# Manual Profile Creation Audit Log Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of automatic audit logging for manual profile creation by administrators. When an admin creates a manual profile, the action is automatically recorded in the Audit Logs with comprehensive details for tracking and transparency.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Audit Log Action Type
- **Action**: `manual_profile_created`
- **Description**: Automatically logged when an admin creates a manual profile through the admin interface

### 2. Audit Log Data Structure
The audit log entry includes the following information:

```json
{
  "userId": "admin",
  "userName": "Admin",
  "action": "manual_profile_created",
  "targetType": "profile",
  "targetId": "<profile_id>",
  "targetName": "<profile_full_name>",
  "schoolYearId": "<school_year_id>",
  "details": {
    "userType": "<student|faculty|staff|alumni>",
    "department": "<department_name>",
    "schoolYear": "<school_year_label>",
    "profileData": {
      "fullName": "<full_name>",
      "email": "<email_address>",
      "age": <age_number>,
      "gender": "<gender>",
      "department": "<department>",
      "courseProgram": "<course_program>",
      "yearLevel": "<year_level>",
      "blockSection": "<block_section>",
      "position": "<position>",
      "graduationYear": "<graduation_year>",
      "currentProfession": "<current_profession>",
      "officeAssigned": "<office_assigned>"
    }
  },
  "userAgent": "<browser_info>",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "<creation_timestamp>"
}
```

### 3. Files Modified

#### `lib/audit-log-utils.ts`
- Added `manual_profile_created` to the allowed actions list
- Modified validation logic to skip profile existence check for manual profile creation (since the profile doesn't exist yet when creating the audit log)

#### `app/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/manual/route.ts`
- Added import for `createAuditLog` and `getClientInfo` functions
- Integrated audit log creation after successful profile insertion
- Includes comprehensive profile details in the audit log
- Handles audit log creation errors gracefully without failing profile creation

### 4. Integration Flow

1. **Admin creates manual profile** through the admin interface
2. **Profile validation** occurs (required fields, email format, age validation)
3. **Profile document** is prepared with all necessary fields
4. **Profile is inserted** into the appropriate yearbook collection
5. **Audit log is created** automatically with:
   - Admin identification
   - Profile details
   - Timestamp
   - Action type: "Create Manual Profile"
   - Comprehensive profile information

### 5. Error Handling

- If audit log creation fails, the profile creation still succeeds
- Audit log errors are logged to console but don't affect the user experience
- All validation errors are properly handled and returned to the client

### 6. Security Features

- Only admin actions are logged (validated by userId and userName)
- Client information (IP address, user agent) is captured
- Comprehensive profile details are stored for audit purposes
- Action is restricted to specific allowed actions list

## Testing

### Test Script
A test script is available at `scripts/test-manual-profile-audit-log.js` that verifies:
- AuditLogs collection exists
- Recent audit logs are accessible
- Manual profile creation logs are properly formatted
- School years and yearbook collections are accessible

### Running the Test
```bash
node scripts/test-manual-profile-audit-log.js
```

## Usage

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to the admin panel
2. Select the appropriate school year
3. Click "Create Manual Profile"
4. Fill in the profile details
5. Submit the form
6. The profile is created and automatically logged in the audit system

### For System Administrators
- Audit logs can be viewed in the admin audit logs section
- All manual profile creations are tracked with full details
- Logs include timestamp, admin name, and comprehensive profile information

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: All manual profile creations are tracked
2. **Accountability**: Admin actions are logged with timestamps
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of manual profile creation
4. **Compliance**: Meets audit requirements for administrative actions
5. **Debugging**: Detailed logs help troubleshoot issues
6. **Security**: Only admin actions are logged, preventing unauthorized logging

## Future Enhancements

- Add admin user identification (currently uses generic "Admin")
- Include more detailed client information
- Add profile modification audit logs
- Implement audit log export functionality
- Add audit log filtering and search capabilities

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Manual profile creation audit logging is fully implemented and tested.
