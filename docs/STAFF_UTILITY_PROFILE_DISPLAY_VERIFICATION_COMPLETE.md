# Staff and Utility Profile Display Verification - Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ **Verification Summary**

The **Staff and Utility profile pages** have been verified to correctly display the **actual Department or Office Assigned** from their form data, rather than mapped building names.

## âœ… **Current Implementation Status**

### **Staff Profile Page (`app/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx`)**

The staff profile page is **already correctly implemented** and displays:

1. **Header Section**:
   ```typescript
   <p className="text-xl text-white/80 mb-6">
     {staff.officeAssigned || staff.departmentAssigned}
   </p>
   ```

2. **Building/Office Info Card**:
   ```typescript
   <span>{staff.officeAssigned || staff.office || 'Office Not Assigned'}</span>
   ```

3. **Contact Information**:
   ```typescript
   <span className="text-gray-700">
     {staff.officeAssigned || staff.office || 'Office Not Assigned'}
   </span>
   ```

4. **Professional Service**:
   ```typescript
   <span className="text-gray-900 font-medium">
     {staff.officeAssigned || staff.departmentAssigned}
   </span>
   ```

### **Faculty Profile Page (`app/faculty/[id]/page.tsx`)**

The faculty profile page is **already correctly implemented** and displays:

1. **Header Section**:
   ```typescript
   <p className="text-xl text-white/80 mb-6">
     {faculty.departmentAssigned || faculty.department} Department
   </p>
   ```

2. **Building/Department Info Card**:
   ```typescript
   <span>
     {faculty.hierarchy === 'staff' || faculty.hierarchy === 'utility' 
       ? faculty.officeAssigned || faculty.office || 'Office Not Assigned'
       : faculty.departmentAssigned || faculty.department || 'Department Not Assigned'
     }
   </span>
   ```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Data Source Priority**:
- **Staff/Utility**: `officeAssigned` â†’ `office` â†’ `'Office Not Assigned'`
- **Faculty**: `departmentAssigned` â†’ `department` â†’ `'Department Not Assigned'`

### **Form Field Mapping**:
- **Staff Forms**: `officeAssigned` field maps to actual office (e.g., "Registrar", "Accounting")
- **Utility Forms**: `officeAssigned` field maps to actual office (e.g., "Maintenance Office")
- **Faculty Forms**: `departmentAssigned` field maps to actual department (e.g., "College", "Senior High")

### **Fallback Handling**:
- Graceful fallback to alternative field names
- Clear "Not Assigned" messages when no data available
- Consistent error handling across all profile types

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Results**

Created test script: `scripts/test-staff-utility-profile-display.js`

### **Test Results:**
```
âœ… staff.officeAssigned: Found 6 usage(s)
âœ… staff.departmentAssigned: Found 3 usage(s)  
âœ… staff.office: Found 9 usage(s)
âœ… Building assignment usage: Correctly removed
âœ… No hardcoded building names found
âœ… Fallback handling: Implemented
ðŸŽ‰ ALL CHECKS PASSED: Staff and Utility profiles correctly display form data!
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Files Verified**

1. **`app/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx`**:
   - âœ… Correctly displays `officeAssigned` from form data
   - âœ… Proper fallback handling implemented
   - âœ… No building assignment mappings used
