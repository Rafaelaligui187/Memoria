# ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING: Plain Text Passwords

## Why You Should NOT Store Plain Text Passwords

### üö® **Security Risks:**
1. **Data Breaches** - If your database is compromised, all passwords are immediately exposed
2. **Identity Theft** - Hackers can use these passwords to access user accounts
3. **Legal Liability** - You could be held responsible for security breaches
4. **User Trust** - Users expect their passwords to be secure
5. **Compliance Issues** - Many regulations require password encryption

### ‚úÖ **Current Secure Implementation:**
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (industry standard)
- Even if database is compromised, passwords cannot be easily recovered
- Follows security best practices

### üîß **If You Must See Plain Text (TESTING ONLY):**

**WARNING: This is for testing purposes only. NEVER use in production!**

To temporarily disable password hashing:

1. **In `app/api/auth/route.ts`** - Comment out the hashing line:
```typescript
// const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password)
const hashedPassword = password // Store plain text (DANGEROUS!)
```

2. **In `app/api/auth/route.ts`** - Comment out password verification:
```typescript
// const isPasswordValid = await verifyPassword(password, user.password)
const isPasswordValid = password === user.password // Plain text comparison (DANGEROUS!)
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Recommended Approach:**
Keep the current secure implementation. If you need to test login, use a known password like "password123" and verify it works through the login form.

### üîç **How to Verify Current Security:**
1. Check MongoDB Atlas
2. Look at the `users` collection
3. You'll see passwords like: `$2a$12$xyz...` (this is secure bcrypt hash)
4. This means passwords are properly protected

## ‚úÖ **Your Current Setup is SECURE and CORRECT!**
