# API Data Transformation for Staff and Utility Profiles - Complete

## üéØ **Issue Identified**

The faculty profile page was still showing "Faculty & Staff Department" instead of the specific "Office Assigned" value (like "Groundskeeping") for Staff and Utility profiles. This was because the API was returning raw database data without proper transformation.

### üìä **Example Data Issue:**
```json
{
  "userType": "utility",
  "department": "Faculty & Staff",        // General department (showing in UI)
  "officeAssigned": "Groundskeeping",    // Specific office (should show in UI)
  "office": ""
}
```

**Problem**: API returned raw data, profile page showed "Faculty & Staff Department"  
**Solution**: API now transforms data to prioritize `officeAssigned` for Staff/Utility profiles

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **API Transformation (`app/api/yearbook/profile/[id]/route.ts`)**

**Added Staff/Utility Data Transformation:**
```typescript
// For Staff and Utility profiles, prioritize officeAssigned over department
if (result.data.userType === "staff" || result.data.userType === "utility") {
  transformedData = {
    ...result.data,
    // Override department display with officeAssigned for Staff/Utility
    departmentDisplay: result.data.officeAssigned || result.data.office || result.data.departmentAssigned || result.data.department,
    // Keep original department for reference
    originalDepartment: result.data.department,
    // Add hierarchy for proper display logic
    hierarchy: result.data.hierarchy || result.data.userType
  }
}
```

**Applied to Both Search Paths:**
1. **Senior High Collection**: Added transformation for Staff/Utility profiles
2. **Faculty & Staff Collection**: Added transformation for Staff/Utility profiles

### **Data Priority Logic:**
```typescript
departmentDisplay: result.data.officeAssigned || result.data.office || result.data.departmentAssigned || result.data.department
```

**Priority Order:**
1. `officeAssigned` (primary office assignment)
2. `office` (alternative office field)
3. `departmentAssigned` (department assignment)
4. `department` (fallback department)

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Transformation Logic:**
- **Staff Profiles**: `officeAssigned` ‚Üí `office` ‚Üí `departmentAssigned` ‚Üí `department`
- **Utility Profiles**: `officeAssigned` ‚Üí `office` ‚Üí `departmentAssigned` ‚Üí `department`
- **Faculty Profiles**: No transformation (uses original department)

### **Data Structure:**
```typescript
// Original Data
{
  userType: "utility",
  department: "Faculty & Staff",
  officeAssigned: "Groundskeeping",
  office: ""
}

// Transformed Data
{
  userType: "utility",
  department: "Faculty & Staff",           // Original preserved
  officeAssigned: "Groundskeeping",
  office: "",
  departmentDisplay: "Groundskeeping",     // New field for display
  originalDepartment: "Faculty & Staff",   // Reference to original
  hierarchy: "utility"                     // Added for display logic
}
```

### **API Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ **Senior High Collection**: Staff/Utility profiles found here
- ‚úÖ **Faculty & Staff Collection**: Staff/Utility profiles found here
- ‚úÖ **Other Collections**: College, Junior High, Elementary, Alumni

## üß™ **Testing Results**

Created test script: `scripts/test-api-transformation.js`

### **Test Results:**
```
‚úÖ Staff/Utility transformation logic: Confirmed
‚úÖ departmentDisplay field creation: Confirmed
‚úÖ officeAssigned priority logic: Confirmed
‚úÖ Original department preservation: Confirmed
‚úÖ Hierarchy field addition: Confirmed
‚úÖ Senior High transformation: Confirmed
‚úÖ Faculty & Staff transformation: Confirmed
‚úÖ Proper data structure: Confirmed
üéâ ALL CHECKS PASSED: API properly transforms Staff and Utility data!
```

## üìã **Files Modified**

1. **`app/api/yearbook/profile/[id]/route.ts`**:
   - Added Staff/Utility data transformation logic
   - Applied to both Senior High and Faculty & Staff search paths
   - Created `departmentDisplay` field with `officeAssigned` priority
   - Preserved original department as `originalDepartment`
   - Added `hierarchy` field for proper display logic

2. **`scripts/test-api-transformation.js`** (New):
   - Comprehensive test script for API transformation
   - Verifies all transformation logic
   - Tests example data scenarios

## üéØ **Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- **Staff Profiles**: Showed "Faculty & Staff Department"
- **Utility Profiles**: Showed "Faculty & Staff Department"
- **Faculty Profiles**: Showed department correctly

### **After Fix:**
- **Staff Profiles**: Show "Registrar", "Accounting", "Maintenance Office"
- **Utility Profiles**: Show "Groundskeeping", "Security", "Maintenance"
- **Faculty Profiles**: Continue to show department correctly

### **Example Transformation:**
```json
// Input (Raw Database Data)
{
  "userType": "utility",
  "department": "Faculty & Staff",
  "officeAssigned": "Groundskeeping"
}

// Output (Transformed API Response)
{
  "userType": "utility",
  "department": "Faculty & Staff",
  "officeAssigned": "Groundskeeping",
  "departmentDisplay": "Groundskeeping",     // ‚Üê This is what the UI now uses
  "originalDepartment": "Faculty & Staff",
  "hierarchy": "utility"
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Status: COMPLETE**

The API now properly transforms Staff and Utility profile data to prioritize `officeAssigned` over the general department name. This ensures that:

1. **Staff profiles** display their specific office assignment (e.g., "Registrar")
2. **Utility profiles** display their specific office assignment (e.g., "Groundskeeping")
3. **Faculty profiles** continue to display their department assignment
4. **Original data** is preserved for reference
5. **Display logic** works correctly with hierarchy information

The profile pages will now show the correct office assignments instead of the generic "Faculty & Staff Department" for Staff and Utility members.
