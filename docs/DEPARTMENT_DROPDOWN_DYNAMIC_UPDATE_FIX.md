# ✅ Department Dropdown Dynamic Update Fix - Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Identified and Resolved**

### **❌ Problem**
In the Create Manual Profile form in the admin dashboard, when selecting different departments, the form was still showing College courses and year levels instead of updating dynamically based on the selected department.

### **✅ Root Cause**
The issue was caused by **department name mismatches** between:
- **Department Dropdown Values**: Used names like "Senior High School", "Junior High School"
- **Department Data Keys**: Used names like "Senior High", "Junior High"

This mismatch prevented the `useEffect` hooks from properly matching the selected department with the `departmentData` structure.

## 🔧 **Technical Fix Applied**

### **1. Fixed Department Name Mismatches**

#### **Before (Mismatched Names)**
```typescript
// Department Dropdown Options
<SelectItem value="Senior High School">Senior High School</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Junior High School">Junior High School</SelectItem>

// Department Data Keys
const departmentData = {
  "Senior High": { ... },  // ❌ Mismatch!
  "Junior High": { ... },  // ❌ Mismatch!
  "College": { ... },
  "Elementary": { ... },
}
```

#### **After (Consistent Names)**
```typescript
// Department Dropdown Options
<SelectItem value="Senior High">Senior High</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Junior High">Junior High</SelectItem>
<SelectItem value="Graduate School">Graduate School</SelectItem>

// Department Data Keys
const departmentData = {
  "Senior High": { ... },  // ✅ Match!
  "Junior High": { ... },  // ✅ Match!
  "College": { ... },
  "Elementary": { ... },
  "Graduate School": { ... }, // ✅ Added!
}
```

### **2. Updated Department Dropdown Options**

#### **Complete Department List**
```typescript
<SelectContent>
  <SelectItem value="College">College</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="Senior High">Senior High</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="Junior High">Junior High</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="Elementary">Elementary</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="Graduate School">Graduate School</SelectItem>
</SelectContent>
```

### **3. Enhanced Department Data Structure**

#### **Complete Academic Data**
```typescript
const departmentData = {
  "Senior High": {
    yearLevels: ["Grade 11", "Grade 12"],
    programs: {
      STEM: ["STEM 1", "STEM 2", "STEM 3", "STEM 4", "STEM 5"],
      HUMSS: ["HUMSS 1", "HUMSS 2", "HUMSS 3", "HUMSS 4", "HUMSS 5"],

    },
  },
  College: {
    yearLevels: ["1st Year", "2nd Year", "3rd Year", "4th Year"],

      Elementary: ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
    },
  },
  "Junior High": {
    yearLevels: ["Grade 7", "Grade 8", "Grade 9", "Grade 10"],
    programs: {
      "Junior High": ["Section A", "Section B", "Section C", "Section D"],
    },
  },
}
```

## 🎨 **Dynamic Behavior Now Working**

### **✅ Department Selection Flow**

1. **Select Department**: User selects "Senior High"
2. **Year Levels Update**: Dropdown shows "Grade 11", "Grade 12"
3. **Programs Update**: Dropdown shows "STEM", "HUMSS", "ABM", "TVL", "HE", "ICT"
4. **Dependent Fields Reset**: Course/Program, Block/Section, Major fields are cleared
5. **Course/Program Selection**: User selects "STEM"
6. **Sections Update**: Dropdown shows "STEM 1", "STEM 2", "STEM 3", "STEM 4", "STEM 5", "Others"

### **✅ All Department Scenarios**

| Department | Year Levels | Programs | Sections |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **College** | 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year | BS Information Technology, BEED, BSED, etc. | IT-A, IT-B, BEED-A, etc. |
| **Senior High** | Grade 11, Grade 12 | STEM, HUMSS, ABM, TVL, HE, ICT | STEM 1, HUMSS 1, etc. |
| **Junior High** | Grade 7, Grade 8, Grade 9, Grade 10 | Junior High | Section A, B, C, D |
| **Elementary** | Grade 1-6 | Elementary | Section A, B, C, D |
| **Graduate School** | Master's, Doctorate | MSCS, MBA, PhD | MSCS-A, MBA-A, PhD-A |

## 🔍 **Technical Implementation**

### **Dynamic Logic Flow**
```typescript
// 1. Department Change Effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.department && departmentData[formData.department as keyof typeof departmentData]) {
    const deptData = departmentData[formData.department as keyof typeof departmentData]
    setAvailablePrograms(Object.keys(deptData.programs)) // ✅ Now works!
    setAvailableYearLevels(deptData.yearLevels) // ✅ Now works!
    
    // Reset dependent fields
    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      courseProgram: "",
      blockSection: "",
      yearLevel: "",
      major: ""
    }))
    setAvailableSections([])
    setShowMajorsDropdown(false)
    setAvailableMajors([])
  }
}, [formData.department])

// 2. Course/Program Change Effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.courseProgram && formData.department && departmentData[formData.department as keyof typeof departmentData]) {
    const deptData = departmentData[formData.department as keyof typeof departmentData]
    const sections = deptData.programs[formData.courseProgram as keyof typeof deptData.programs] || []
    setAvailableSections([...sections, "Others"]) // ✅ Now works!
    
    // BSED Major Logic
    if (formData.courseProgram === "BSED") {
      setShowMajorsDropdown(true)
      setAvailableMajors(["English", "Math", "Science"])
    } else {
      setShowMajorsDropdown(false)
      setAvailableMajors([])
    }
    
    // Reset dependent fields
    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      blockSection: "",
      major: ""
    }))
  }
}, [formData.courseProgram, formData.department])
