# ‚úÖ Corrected Form Input Display - Implementation Complete

## üéØ **Issue Resolution**

Fixed the display logic to show the **original form input values** instead of mapped building names. Faculty profiles now display "Department Assigned" and Staff/Utility profiles display "Office Assigned" exactly as entered in the forms.

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Faculty Profile Page Updates**
**File**: `app/faculty/[id]/page.tsx`

#### **Corrected Display Logic**
```typescript
// Before: Showed mapped building names
const buildingAssignment = getBuildingAssignment(...)
return buildingAssignment ? buildingAssignment.building : ...

// After: Shows original form input values
{faculty.hierarchy === 'staff' || faculty.hierarchy === 'utility' 
  ? faculty.officeAssigned || faculty.office || 'Office Not Assigned'
  : faculty.departmentAssigned || faculty.department || 'Department Not Assigned'
}
```

#### **Key Changes**
- ‚úÖ **Faculty Profiles**: Display `departmentAssigned || department` from form input
- ‚úÖ **Staff/Utility Profiles**: Display `officeAssigned || office` from form input
- ‚úÖ **Removed Building Mapping**: No longer shows mapped building names
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data

### **2. Staff Profile Page Updates**
**File**: `app/staff/[staffId]/page.tsx`

#### **Corrected Display Logic**
```typescript
// Before: Showed mapped building names
const buildingAssignment = getBuildingAssignment(...)
return buildingAssignment ? buildingAssignment.building : ...

// After: Shows original form input values
{staff.officeAssigned || staff.office || 'Office Not Assigned'}
```

#### **Key Changes**
- ‚úÖ **Staff Profiles**: Display `officeAssigned || office` from form input
- ‚úÖ **Updated Multiple Sections**: Both header and contact information sections
- ‚úÖ **Removed Building Mapping**: No longer shows mapped building names
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Display**: Same logic across all profile sections

## üéØ **Display Results**

### **Faculty Profile Example**
- **Form Input**: Department Assigned = "College of Computers Department"
- **Display**: "College of Computers Department"
- **Icon**: Building icon with department name
- **NOT**: "Computer Science Building" (mapped building name)

### **Staff Profile Example**
- **Form Input**: Office Assigned = "Registrar"
- **Display**: "Registrar"
- **Icon**: Building icon with office name
- **NOT**: "Administration Building" (mapped building name)

### **Utility Profile Example**
- **Form Input**: Office Assigned = "Maintenance Office"
- **Display**: "Maintenance Office"
- **Icon**: Building icon with office name
- **NOT**: "Maintenance Building" (mapped building name)
