# ✅ School Year Assignment in Manual Profile Creation - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

### **✅ Automatic School Year Detection & Assignment**
- **Smart Detection**: System automatically detects the currently selected or active School Year
- **Proper Assignment**: Manual profiles are assigned the correct School Year ID and label
- **Database Storage**: Both `schoolYearId` and `schoolYear` (human-readable label) are stored
- **Cross-Section Display**: School Year displays correctly across all related sections

### **✅ Enhanced Data Structure**
- **Dual Storage**: Profiles store both the School Year ID and the human-readable label
- **Consistent Display**: School Year appears as "2025–2026" instead of "N/A" or raw ID
- **Proper Mapping**: Correct School Year data is fetched from the `SchoolYears` collection

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Updated API Endpoint: `/api/admin/[yearId]/profiles/manual`**

#### **School Year Fetching Logic**
```typescript
// Fetch school year data to get the label
const db = await connectToDatabase()
const schoolYearsCollection = db.collection("SchoolYears")
const schoolYearDoc = await schoolYearsCollection.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(params.yearId) })

if (!schoolYearDoc) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    message: "School year not found"
  }, { status: 404 })
}

const schoolYearLabel = schoolYearDoc.yearLabel
```

#### **Enhanced Profile Document**
```typescript
const profileDocument = {
  // Core fields
  ownedBy: tempUserId,
  schoolYearId: params.yearId,        // School Year ID (e.g., "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c")
  schoolYear: schoolYearLabel,        // School Year Label (e.g., "2025–2026")
  userType: userType,
  profileStatus: "approved",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Updated Faculty API: `/api/faculty`**

#### **Enhanced Data Transformation**
```typescript
const transformedProfiles = facultyProfiles.map((profile, index) => ({
  // ... other fields
  schoolYear: profile.schoolYear || profile.schoolYearId || "Unknown", // Use label first, fallback to ID
  schoolYearId: profile.schoolYearId || "Unknown", // Keep the ID as well
  // ... other fields
}))
```

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **School Year Assignment Flow**
1. **Admin Selection**: Admin selects School Year (e.g., "2025–2026") in the dashboard
2. **API Call**: Manual profile creation API receives the School Year ID
3. **Database Lookup**: System fetches the School Year document from `SchoolYears` collection
4. **Label Extraction**: Extracts the human-readable label (e.g., "2025–2026")
5. **Profile Creation**: Creates profile with both `schoolYearId` and `schoolYear` fields
6. **Database Storage**: Profile is saved with complete School Year information
7. **Display**: Profile displays "2025–2026" instead of "N/A" across all sections

### **Data Flow Example**
```
Admin Dashboard (School Year: "2025–2026") 
    ↓
Manual Profile Creation API (yearId: "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c")
    ↓
Database Lookup (SchoolYears collection)
    ↓
Extract Label ("2025–2026")
    ↓
Create Profile Document {
  schoolYearId: "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c",
  schoolYear: "2025–2026",
  // ... other fields
}
    ↓
Save to Database Collection
    ↓
Display in Faculty/Staff Pages: "2025–2026"
```

## 📊 **Database Structure**

### **School Years Collection**
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId("68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c"),
  yearLabel: "2025–2026",
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### **Profile Document Structure**
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  schoolYearId: "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c",  // School Year ID
  schoolYear: "2025–2026",                   // Human-readable label
  userType: "faculty",
  profileStatus: "approved",
  fullName: "John Doe",
  // ... other profile fields
}
```

## 🎨 **User Experience**

- **Tests**:
  - Fetches available School Years
  - Creates manual profile with specific School Year
  - Verifies School Year assignment in database
  - Confirms proper display in Faculty API

### **Expected Results**
```javascript
// Test output example:
✅ Available school years: [
  { id: "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c", label: "2025–2026", isActive: true },
  { id: "68e0f728108ee73737d5a13d", label: "2024–2025", isActive: true }
]

✅ Profile school year details: {
  schoolYear: "2025–2026",           // Human-readable label
  schoolYearId: "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c", // Database ID
  expectedSchoolYear: "2025–2026",
  schoolYearMatch: true,
  schoolYearIdMatch: true
}

🎉 SUCCESS: School year assignment is working correctly!
```

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

### **School Year Not Found**
```typescript
if (!schoolYearDoc) {
  console.log("[Manual Profile] School year not found:", params.yearId)
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    message: "School year not found"
  }, { status: 404 })
}
```

### **Fallback Display**
```typescript
schoolYear: profile.schoolYear || profile.schoolYearId || "Unknown"
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**

The School Year assignment feature is now **fully functional** and ready for production:

- ✅ **Build Success**: Project compiles without errors
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: System detects and assigns correct School Year
- ✅ **Proper Storage**: Both ID and label stored in database
- ✅ **Correct Display**: School Year shows as "2025–2026" across all sections
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing School Years

## 📝 **Summary**

The manual profile creation feature now **automatically detects and assigns the correct School Year** based on the currently selected or active School Year. When an admin creates a profile under School Year "2025–2026", the system:

1. **Detects** the School Year from the admin's selection
2. **Fetches** the School Year data from the database
3. **Assigns** both the ID and human-readable label to the profile
4. **Stores** the complete School Year information in the database
5. **Displays** "2025–2026" instead of "N/A" across all sections

**The system now ensures that all manual profiles have proper School Year assignment and display correctly across Faculty and Staff pages, Profile Management, and all other related sections.**
