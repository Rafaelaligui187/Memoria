# Audit Log Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that when an admin deletes a user account, all associated audit logs are automatically removed from the system. This maintains data privacy and prevents orphaned audit log entries.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Layer Updates

#### MongoDB Database (`lib/mongodb-database.ts`)
- **Added `deleteAuditLogsByUserId(userId: string)` method**: Deletes all audit logs associated with a specific user
- **Updated `deleteUser(id: string)` method**: Now automatically calls `deleteAuditLogsByUserId()` when a user is deleted

#### Mock Database (`lib/database.ts`)
- **Added `deleteAuditLogsByUserId(userId: string)` method**: Mock implementation for testing
- **Updated `deleteUser(id: string)` method**: Now automatically cleans up audit logs

#### Database Interface (`lib/database.ts`)
- **Added `deleteAuditLogsByUserId(userId: string): Promise<number>` to DatabaseConnection interface**

### 2. API Route Updates

#### Profile Deletion API (`app/api/profiles/route.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE method**: Now automatically removes audit logs when a profile is deleted
- Uses the profile's `ownedBy` field to identify the user and clean up their audit logs

#### User Deletion API (`app/api/admin/[yearId]/users/[userId]/route.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE method**: Now calls `db.deleteAuditLogsByUserId()` when deleting users
- Handles both mock data scenarios and real database operations

### 3. Automatic Cleanup Points

The audit log cleanup is triggered in the following scenarios:

1. **Direct User Deletion**: When `db.deleteUser()` is called
2. **Profile Deletion**: When a profile is deleted via the profiles API
3. **Bulk User Operations**: When users are deleted in bulk operations
4. **Admin User Management**: When admins delete users through the admin interface

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- Audit log cleanup failures do not prevent user deletion
- Errors are logged but don't cause the main operation to fail
- This ensures system reliability while maintaining cleanup functionality

### Logging
- All audit log cleanup operations are logged with details
- Includes count of deleted audit logs and user ID
- Helps with debugging and monitoring

### Database Consistency
- Uses MongoDB's `deleteMany()` for efficient bulk deletion
- Maintains referential integrity by cleaning up orphaned records
- Works with both MongoDB and mock database implementations

## Testing

A test script (`test-audit-log-cleanup.js`) has been created to verify:
- Audit log creation and retrieval
- Direct audit log cleanup functionality
- User deletion with automatic audit log cleanup
- Verification that audit logs are properly removed

## Usage

The cleanup is automatic and requires no additional configuration. When any of the following operations occur:

1. Admin deletes a user account
2. Profile is deleted (which removes the associated user)
3. Bulk user deletion operations
4. Any other user deletion operation

The system will automatically:
1. Delete the user from the users collection
2. Delete all audit logs associated with that user
3. Log the cleanup operation
4. Continue with the main operation

## Benefits

- **Data Privacy**: Ensures deleted users' audit trails are completely removed
- **Database Cleanliness**: Prevents orphaned audit log entries
- **Compliance**: Helps with data retention and privacy requirements
- **Performance**: Reduces database size by removing unnecessary records
- **Reliability**: Automatic cleanup reduces manual maintenance needs
