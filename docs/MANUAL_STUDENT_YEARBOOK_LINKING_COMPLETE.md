# ‚úÖ Manual Student Profile Yearbook Collection Linking - Complete

## üéØ **Requirement Fulfilled**

**‚úÖ When an admin creates a student profile using the Create Manual Profile feature, it is automatically linked and fetched into the designated yearbook corresponding to the School Year selected by the admin. The created student profile appears instantly in the correct yearbook collection without requiring approval or manual assignment, maintaining consistency and accuracy in the yearbook records.**

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Fixed Department Name Consistency**

#### **‚úÖ Updated Manual Profile API**
```typescript
// Fixed department mapping in getCollectionName function
const departmentMap: Record<string, string> = {
  "College": "College_yearbook",
  "Senior High": "SeniorHigh_yearbook", 
  "Junior High": "JuniorHigh_yearbook",
  "Elementary": "Elementary_yearbook",
  "Graduate School": "College_yearbook" // Graduate students go to College yearbook
}
```

#### **‚úÖ Consistent Department Names**
- **Before**: "Senior High School", "Junior High School" (mismatched)
- **After**: "Senior High", "Junior High" (matches departmentData keys)
- **Added**: "Graduate School" option for graduate students

### **2. Enhanced Profile Document Structure**

#### **‚úÖ Complete Profile Document**
```typescript
const profileDocument = {
  // Core fields
  ownedBy: tempUserId,
  schoolYearId: params.yearId,
  schoolYear: schoolYearLabel, // Human-readable school year (e.g., "2025-2026")
  userType: userType,
  profileStatus: "approved", // Manual profiles are automatically approved
  status: "approved", // Also set status for yearbook compatibility
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
  submittedAt: new Date(),
  reviewedAt: new Date(),
  reviewedBy: "admin",
  
  // Profile data
  ...profileData,
  
  // Ensure profile picture is properly set
  profilePicture: profileData.profilePicture || "",
  
  // Legacy compatibility fields
  name: profileData.fullName,
  role: userType,
  department: profileData.department || profileData.departmentAssigned || "",
  
  // Additional metadata for manual profiles
  isManualProfile: true,
  createdByAdmin: true,
}
```

### **3. Automatic School Year Assignment**

#### **‚úÖ School Year Label Fetching**
```typescript
// Fetch school year data to get the label
const db = await connectToDatabase()
const schoolYearsCollection = db.collection("SchoolYears")
const schoolYearDoc = await schoolYearsCollection.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(params.yearId) })

if (!schoolYearDoc) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    message: "School year not found"
  }, { status: 404 })
}

const schoolYearLabel = schoolYearDoc.yearLabel
console.log("[Manual Profile] School year label:", schoolYearLabel)
```

#### **‚úÖ Dual School Year Storage**
- **`schoolYearId`**: Stores the MongoDB ObjectId (e.g., "68e0f71e108ee73737d5a13c")
- **`schoolYear`**: Stores the human-readable label (e.g., "2025‚Äì2026")

### **4. Correct Yearbook Collection Mapping**

#### **‚úÖ Department to Collection Mapping**
| Department | Collection | Example Student |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **College** | `College_yearbook` | BS Information Technology students |
| **Senior High** | `SeniorHigh_yearbook` | STEM, HUMSS, ABM students |
| **Junior High** | `JuniorHigh_yearbook` | Grade 7-10 students |
| **Elementary** | `Elementary_yearbook` | Grade 1-6 students |
| **Graduate School** | `College_yearbook` | Master's, Doctorate students |

#### **‚úÖ Automatic Collection Selection**
```typescript
function getCollectionName(userType: string, department?: string): string {
  if (userType === "student" && department) {
    const departmentMap: Record<string, string> = {
      "College": "College_yearbook",
      "Senior High": "SeniorHigh_yearbook", 
      "Junior High": "JuniorHigh_yearbook",
      "Elementary": "Elementary_yearbook",
      "Graduate School": "College_yearbook"
    }
    return departmentMap[department] || "College_yearbook"
  }
  // ... other user types
}
```
