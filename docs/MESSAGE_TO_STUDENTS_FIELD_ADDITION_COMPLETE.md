  yearsOfService: formData.yearsOfService ? Number(formData.yearsOfService) : undefined,
  messageToStudents: formData.messageToStudents, // ‚Üê Added
}),
```

**Form Field Addition:**
```typescript
// Added to both Staff and Utility sections
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Label htmlFor="messageToStudents">Message to Students</Label>
  <Textarea
    id="messageToStudents"
    placeholder="Share a message with your students"
    value={formData.messageToStudents}
    onChange={(e) => handleInputChange("messageToStudents", e.target.value)}
    rows={3}
  />
</div>
```

### **2. Unified Profile Setup Form (`components/unified-profile-setup-form.tsx`)**

**Data Submission Updates:**
```typescript
// Staff/Utility data submission
...((selectedRole === "staff" || selectedRole === "utility") && {
  position: formData.position,
  department: "Faculty & Staff",
  officeAssigned: formData.officeAssigned === "Others" ? formData.customOfficeAssigned : formData.officeAssigned,
  yearsOfService: formData.yearsOfService,
  messageToStudents: formData.messageToStudents, // ‚Üê Added
}),
```

**Form Field Display Updates:**
```typescript
// Changed from Faculty-only to Faculty/Staff/Utility
{(selectedRole === "faculty" || selectedRole === "staff" || selectedRole === "utility") && (
  <>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <Label htmlFor="messageToStudents">Message to Students *</Label>
      <Textarea
        id="messageToStudents"
        placeholder="Always stay curious."
        value={formData.messageToStudents}
        onChange={(e) => handleInputChange("messageToStudents", e.target.value)}
        className={errors.messageToStudents ? "border-red-500" : ""}
        rows={3}
      />
      {errors.messageToStudents && <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{errors.messageToStudents}</p>}
    </div>

    {/* Faculty-specific fields remain Faculty-only */}
    {selectedRole === "faculty" && (
      <>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <Label htmlFor="courses">Courses Taught</Label>
          {/* ... */}
        </div>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <Label htmlFor="additionalRoles">Additional Roles & Responsibilities</Label>
          {/* ... */}
        </div>
      </>
    )}
  </>
)}
```
