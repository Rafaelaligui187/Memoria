# Bio and Message to Students Separation - Complete

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

The faculty profile page had **mixed content** in the "About Faculty" section where both the **bio** and **message to students** were displayed together, causing confusion about what content belongs where.

### ❌ **Problems Found:**
1. **Mixed Content**: The "About Faculty" tab was showing both `faculty.bio` AND `faculty.messageToStudents`
2. **Confusing Layout**: Users couldn't distinguish between personal bio and message to students
3. **Poor UX**: Content was duplicated between tabs
4. **Inconsistent Structure**: Bio and message should be in separate, dedicated sections

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Separated Bio Content** in "About Faculty" tab:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (Mixed content):
   {faculty.bio ? (
     <div className="space-y-4">
       <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
         {faculty.bio}
       </p>
       {faculty.messageToStudents && (
         <div className="mt-6 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
           <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
             <Heart className="h-4 w-4" />
             Message to Students
           </h4>
           <p className="text-gray-700 italic">
             "{faculty.messageToStudents}"
           </p>
         </div>
       )}
     </div>
   ) : (
     // ... fallback content
   )}
   
   // AFTER (Clean separation):
   {faculty.bio ? (
     <div className="space-y-4">
       <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
         {faculty.bio}
       </p>
     </div>
   ) : (
     // ... fallback content
   )}
   ```

2. **Confirmed Message to Students Tab**:
   - The "Message to Students" tab already correctly displays only `faculty.messageToStudents`
   - No changes needed to this section
